Develop a web application using Python to establish a peer-to-peer marketplace that accommodates both digital and physical goods. The application will run on an Ubuntu22 server, and I'm seeking the complete source code, ensuring all functionalities are implemented. The marketplace will exclusively use Monero for transactions, with users acquiring a unique Monero subaddress during registration via Monero RPC on localhost:18080. User-associated subaddresses will be tracked for transactions. To enhance security, implement a captcha during registration and login, utilizing an open-source, alphanumeric five-figure combination to thwart bots. The marketplace will be designed with a dark theme and blue text, ensuring mobile responsiveness and displaying Monero account balances at the top. Incorporate the CoinGecko API for USD conversion, displaying rates in the footer. Products should feature dual pricing in Monero and USD. Allow user withdrawals to Monero addresses, to be manually processed by the admin upon withdrawal requests. Deposits will be automatically credited after at least 2 confirmations, confirmed by Monero wallet RPC. Implement a commission of 8 percent on all sales, paid by the buyer upon completion. Buyer-seller messaging will be accessible at products page, and admin intervention in disputes is enabled. Contact admin will be the sole means for password recovery. Admin-managed product categories and an inclusive forum for user discussions will be incorporated. The admin dashboard control includes editing hostname, port, overseeing user withdrawal requests, managing users (delete, ban, create, add user balance), and viewing all transactions in the marketplace. Provide all root files complete with code so that the marketplace can be installed and run seamlessly on the server at . The script should be cloned to the server's  folder, connected to the MySQL database, and the admin will access the admin dashboard via . The admin should be able to change the app icon and logo on the admin dashboard and add new categories from there. The default name for the marketplace is 'Bunker,' and the admin name is 'mrbunker' with the password '12345678,' which can be changed later. Provide all files with complete code for a functional marketplace. Include the database schema. Sellers should be able to upload a product image when creating a product, choose a category, provide a description, name the product, and set the price in USD. The marketplace will convert the price to Monero using AJAX and display both prices on the product listing. Implement live price updates using AJAX, fetching Monero rates every minute. The Monero wallet RPC is already running smoothly on the installation server on localhost port 18080. To guide the installation process, list all the files in their respective folders, providing a detailed installation guide from cloning from GitHub to adding new categories. Ensure all functions are implemented, including the captcha and Monero RPC functionalities..
